# ThompsonSampling

This package uses the algorithm suggested in section IV.C of Shahriari et al. (2015), "Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization", *Proceedings of the IEEE*. 

I have been playing around with this as a way to optimize hyperparameters of neural networks. It works for me, but use at your own risk. If you have any suggestions or pull requests, I am open to them.
